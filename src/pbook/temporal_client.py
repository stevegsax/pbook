"""Single chokepoint for connecting to the Temporal frontend.

Every pbook process — each CLI command and the worker — connects to
Temporal through :func:`connect_temporal` so that the security-critical
TLS / mTLS configuration lives in exactly one place.

By default (``PBOOK_TEMPORAL_TLS`` unset) the connection is plaintext.
That is correct for a worker talking to a co-located Temporal at
``127.0.0.1:7233`` behind the instance firewall. Remote CLIs that reach
the frontend over the internet set ``PBOOK_TEMPORAL_TLS=1`` and provide a
client certificate/key, authenticating with mutual TLS (mTLS) — the
mechanism that gates access so only holders of a CA-signed certificate
can connect.

Environment variables
---------------------
``PBOOK_TEMPORAL_TLS``
    Enable TLS when truthy (``1``/``true``/``yes``/``on``). Unset ⇒ plaintext.
``PBOOK_TEMPORAL_TLS_SERVER_CA``
    PEM file holding the CA that signed the server certificate. Required
    when the server uses a private/internal CA (the usual case here).
``PBOOK_TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERT`` / ``PBOOK_TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_KEY``
    PEM files for this client's certificate and private key. Supplying
    both turns on mTLS; they must be provided together.
``PBOOK_TEMPORAL_TLS_SERVER_NAME``
    Override the expected server name (SNI / certificate name) when the
    address dialed differs from the certificate's SAN.
